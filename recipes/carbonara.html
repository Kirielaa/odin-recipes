    An italian classic carbonara.
    <p>This traditional carbonara recipe was created in the Lazio region (the area around Rome)
        in the middle of the 20th century, after World War II. We don't use cream, milk, garlic, onions,
        or other extra ingredients; we use only guanciale, eggs, Pecorino Romano cheese, and lots of black pepper 
        (carbonaro is Italian for coal miner). This isn't the Italian-American version, it's the real,
        creamy carbonara and it comes right from Italy, where I live. Buon appetito.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        <li>200grams of guanciale, diced</li>
        <li>190grams of Spaghetti or Spaghettoni</li>
        <li>3 large eggs (Can do 2 whole and 1 white)</li>
        <li>180 grams of grated Pecorino Romano cheese </li>
        <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste (ADD LOTS!!)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; add guanciale. Cook, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and crispy, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and drain on paper towels if too much grease.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 9 minutes. Drain and return to the pot. Let cool, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk eggs, 1/2 of the Pecorino Romano cheese, and some black pepper in a bowl until smooth and creamy.Now the important step, you have to work fast or you'll end up with scrambled eggs: Pour egg mixture over pasta, stirring quickly, until creamy and slightly cooled. Serve and top with Pecorino Romano cheese and more black pepper.</li>
