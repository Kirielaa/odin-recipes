    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 day old leftover rice, cold.</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Red Chilli</li>
        <li>Chalot</li>
        <li>Spring Onion</li>
        <li>2 whole eggs, or 1 and 1 egg Yolk</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. Soy sauce, sesame oil</li>
        <li>White pepper to taste</li>
        <li>MSG, the king of flavour</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>You should already have the rice made from the day before, sitting in the fridge,
            can be made with chicken stock instead of water, or half and half.
            <p>First let's make the base, whisk the eggs in a small bowl, smash the garlic cloves 
                and cut them in small cubes, cut the shallot the same way.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Cut the red chilli and the spring onion the same way, set them aside.</li>
        <li>Coat the wok with your oil of preference, peanut or normal oil (Dont' use olive oil),
            once it starts smoking pour the excess oil out of the wok. Add the garlic and shallot and let them fry for about 3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Afterwards add the eggs in the wok and stir until it's almost solid. Followed by the rice and mix everything together.
            <p>Add the soy sauce, sesame oil and the white pepper. TIP: flatten the rice with the back of the spoon to unclamp the rice.</p>
            <p>Add the MSG, spring onion and the chilli. You don't want to fry these, they're garnish, keep stiring everything together for a minute or so.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Final step: Enjoy.</li>
